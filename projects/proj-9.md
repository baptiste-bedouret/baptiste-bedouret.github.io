title: 'Projet 9: Parallel computing'
---

The goal of this project is to perform a reproducible simulation by using parallel computing. For this project we decided to work on the topic of Non parametric classification. To apply the classification we chose two models to study. SVM and Random Forest. Thus, the objective is to try to detect which is the best non parametric classifier among those two in term of performance and computation time while applying a simulation.
